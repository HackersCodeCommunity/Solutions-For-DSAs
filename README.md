# Solutions-For-DSAs

This is a repo, that contains the solutions for different DSA questions, in different programming languages.


The problems are separated based on difficulty:

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard
* Very Hard

The goal of this repo is to provide solutions to several DSA problems. We could make it just a bunch of solutions, but, for the purpose of making this repo useful to anyone, we'll have Pseudocode and Algorithm explanations added in a markdown per problem solved.


This repo will contain 170 questions (Easy + Medium + Hard + Very Hard). I believe this open source repo will be beneficial to anyone struggling with DSA out there as the repo will have several branches with each branch dedicated to solutions for a specific programming Language.


The main branch will be for explanations of General Data structures and algorithms problems.

The repo contains questions from [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io) which as the time of the creation of this repo had 170 interview questions.

## Please Note: Every programming language will have their specific branch, for their seperate solutions.
